#Bakground
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. This project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. We were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The goal of this assignment is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This assignment will:

A. create a report describing how the model is built
B. how cross validation is use
C. what is the expected out of sample error and why we made the choices we did
D. use prediction model to predict 20 different test cases


```{r}
# Setting up the environment
library(randomForest)
library(gbm)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
```
#Data Loading

The data for this assignment was obtained from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 
Two data set were available: training data and testing data. 

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Nitish/Documents")
pmlTraining<-read.csv("pml-training.csv", header=T, na.strings=c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))
pmlTesting<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv", header=T, na.string=c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))
dim(pmlTraining)
dim(pmlTesting)
```

#Data Cleaning

Excluding variables with at least one "NA", variables with nearly zero variance, and variables that don't make intuitive sense for prediction.Same variables were maintained in the test data set (Validation dataset) to be used for predicting the 20 test cases provided.

```{r}
## NA exclusion 
pmlTrainNoNA<-pmlTraining[, apply(pmlTraining, 2, function(x) !any(is.na(x)))] 
dim(pmlTrainNoNA)

## variables with user information, time and undefined
pmlTrainingClean<-pmlTrainNoNA[,-c(1:8)]
dim(pmlTrainingClean)

##Remove NearZeroVariance variables

pmlTrainNzv <- nearZeroVar(pmlTrainingClean, saveMetrics=TRUE)
pmlTrainingCleanNew <- pmlTrainingClean[,pmlTrainNzv$nzv==FALSE]
dim(pmlTrainingCleanNew)

## 20 test cases provided clean info - Validation data set
pmlTestingClean<-pmlTesting[,names(pmlTrainingCleanNew[,-52])]
dim(pmlTestingClean)

```

#Data Partitioning and Prediction Process

The cleaned downloaded data set was subset in order to generate a test set independent from the 20 cases provided set. Partitioning was performed to obtain a 60% training set and a 40% test set.

```{r}
inTrainingData<-createDataPartition(y=pmlTrainingCleanNew$classe, p=0.60,list=FALSE)
myTrainData <- pmlTrainingCleanNew[inTrainingData,]
dim(myTrainData)

myTestData <- pmlTrainingClean[-inTrainingData,] 
dim(myTestData)
```
#Results and Conclusions

###Prediction with Decision Trees

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
modFit1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTrainData, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFit1)
predict1 <- predict(modFit1, myTestData, type = "class")  
confusionMatrix(predict1, myTestData$classe)  
```
The accuracy is 69%, thus the predicted accuracy for the out-of-sample error is 31%.

###Prediction with Generalized Boosted Regression

```{r}
fitControl1<-trainControl(method="cv", number=5, allowParallel=T,verboseIter = T)

```
The accuracy is 96%, thus the predicted accuracy for the out-of-sample error is 4%.


###Prediction with Random Forests

```{r}
fitControl <- trainControl(method="cv", number=5, allowParallel=T, verboseIter=T)
rffit<-train(classe~.,data=myTrainData, method="rf", trControl=fitControl, verbose=F)
predict3<-predict(rffit, newdata=myTrainData)
confusionMatrix(predict3, myTrainData$classe)
predrf<-predict(rffit, newdata=myTestData)
confusionMatrix(predrf, myTestData$classe)

```
The accuracy is 99%, thus the predicted accuracy for the out-of-sample error is 1%. We choose **Random Forests** because it produce better results. Below is the formula to submit as answers for this project.

```{r}
predictpmlTesting<-predict(rffit, newdata=pmlTesting)
# Output for the prediction of the 20 cases provided
predictpmlTesting

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:20){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(predictpmlTesting)
```
